# AudioBook_Cust_retention_prediction
Uses basic neural net to predict if a customer will buy again or not. We have used pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and Tensorflow and keras.
We got four notebooks here - 4th notebook is best.
we did some mistakes in 1st and 2nd notebook, i have included it for educational purpose.
Pipeline in 3rd notebook is perfectly designed and production-grade for a binary classification task using neural networks.
We also got 4th notebook, where we increased depth (number of layers) and width (number of neurons) of neural net.
We also added dropout to prevent overfitting and have included learning rate with Adam optimizer.
